This is the corpus with rich metaphor annotation in English described in [this '15 paper](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/pubs/met2015b.pdf). The annotation process is thoroughly described in the paper.

Further materials on metaphor cource and target annotation:
- [another '16 paper](https://aclanthology.org/L16-1668.pdf) with a full list of source and target domains;
- [data](https://github.com/PolinaZulik/Metaphors_in_PLMs/tree/main/data/source_target_detection) annotated, presumably, with the latter source and target domains: domain numbers are only present, the domain names have to be aligned manually.
